# 🧪 EDA for Machine Learning

This project demonstrates **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and preprocessing techniques on a sample dataset generated in Python.  
It is designed as a step-by-step workflow for preparing raw data before applying Machine Learning models.

## 📌 Project Highlights
- ✅ Generate synthetic dataset with numerical & categorical features  
- ✅ Identify and handle missing values  
- ✅ Detect and remove duplicate records  
- ✅ Outlier detection and treatment  
- ✅ Feature distribution analysis (normality, skewness)  
- ✅ Correlation analysis between variables  
- ✅ Data preprocessing with scaling, encoding, and imputing
